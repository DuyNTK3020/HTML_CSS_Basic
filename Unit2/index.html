    <h2>Meet Laravel</h2>
    <p>
      Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Laravel?</h3>
    <p>
      There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building
      a web application.
    </p>

    <h4>A Progressive Framework</h4>
    <p>
      We like to call Laravel a “progressive” framework. By that, we mean that
      Laravel grows with you.
    </p>
    <h4>A Scalable Framework</h4>
    <p>
      Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of
      PHP and Laravel’s built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems
      like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze.

    <h2>Your First Laravel Project</h2>
    <p>
      Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your
      local machine has PHP and Composer installed.
    </p>

    <h2>Laravel & Docker</h2>
