    <!-- Meet Laravel -->
    <h2 id="meet-laravel">Meet Laravel</h2>

    <p>
      Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A
      web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your
      application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we
      sweat the details.
    </p>

    <p>
      Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing
      powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive
      database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and
      integration testing, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience,
      Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your
      first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your
      expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.
    </p>

    <!-- Why Laravel? -->
    <h3 id="why-laravel">Why Laravel?</h3>

    <p>
      There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building
      a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for
      building modern, full-stack web applications.
    </p>

    <h4>A Progressive Framework</h4>

    <p>
      We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that
      Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web
      development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and video
      tutorials will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for
      dependency injection, unit testing, queues, real-time events, and more.
      Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready
      to handle enterprise work loads.
    </p>

    <h4>A Scalable Framework</h4>
    <p>
      Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of
      PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems
      like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel
      applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of
      requests per month.
    </p>

    <p>
      Need extreme scaling? Platforms like Laravel Vapor allow you to run your
      Laravel application at nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless
      technology.
    </p>

    <h4>A Community Framework</h4>
    <p>
      Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most
      robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition, thousands
      of talented developers from around the world have contributed to the
      framework. Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.
    </p>

    <!-- Your First Laravel Project -->
    <h2 id="your-first-laravel-project">Your First Laravel Project</h2>
    <p>
      Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your
      local machine has PHP and Composer installed. If you are developing on
      macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via Homebrew. In addition, we
      recommend installing Node and NPM.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application
      will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8000. Next,
      you're ready to start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem.
      Of course, you may also want to configure a database.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would like a head start when developing your Laravel application,
      consider using one of our starter kits. Laravel's starter kits provide
      backend and frontend authentication scaffolding for your new Laravel
      application.
    </p>

    <!-- Laravel & Docker -->
    <h2 id="laravel-and-docker">Laravel & Docker</h2>

    <p>
      We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel
      regardless of your preferred operating system. So, there are a variety of
      options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local
      machine. While you may wish to explore these options at a later time,
      Laravel provides Sail, a built-in solution for running your Laravel
      project using Docker.
    </p>

    <p>
      Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small,
      light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's
      installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry
      about configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web
      servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need
      to install Docker Desktop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with
      Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting
      point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis
      without requiring prior Docker experience.
    </p>

    <!-- Getting Started On macOS -->
    <h3 id="getting-started-on-macos">Getting Started On macOS</h3>

    <p>
      If you're developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you
      can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like -
      just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric
      characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory
      will be created within the directory you execute the command from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application
      containers are built on your local machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access
      the application in your web browser at: http://localhost.
    </p>

    <!-- Getting Started On Windows -->
    <h3 id="getting-started-on-windows">Getting Started On Windows</h3>

    <p>
      Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make
      sure to install Docker Desktop. Next, you should ensure that Windows
      Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is installed and enabled. WSL allows you to
      run Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10. Information on how to
      install and enable WSL2 can be found within Microsoft's developer
      environment documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application
      containers are built on your local machine.
    </p>

    <!-- Getting Started On Linux -->
    <h3 id="getting-started-on-linux">Getting Started On Linux</h3>
    <p>
      If you're developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you
      can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like -
      just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric
      characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory
      will be created within the directory you execute the command from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application
      containers are built on your local machine.
    </p>

    <!-- Choosing Your Sail Services -->
    <h3 id="choosing-your-sail-services">Choosing Your Sail Services</h3>

    <p>
      When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the with
      query string variable to choose which services should be configured in
      your new application's docker-compose.yml file.
    </p>

    <p>
      All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the
      config directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through
      the files and get familiar with the options available to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are
      free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the
      config/app.php file and its documentation. It contains several options
      such as timezone and locale that you may wish to change according to your
      application.
